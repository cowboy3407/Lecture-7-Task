                    have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I
                    signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly
                    fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was
                    the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                    completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,
                    working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</div>

                    written a line of code. I needed some structure
                    from professionals who can help me learn programming step by
                    step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about
                    the program. The entire curriculum and staff did
                    not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
                    wait long for assistance. The agile team project,
                    in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
                    next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
                    have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews
                    as an example of my developent experience. It
                    certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
                    after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
